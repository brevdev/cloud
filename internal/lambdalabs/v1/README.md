# Lambda Labs Provider

This directory contains the Lambda Labs provider implementation for the compute package.

## Overview

The Lambda Labs provider implements the CloudClient interface defined in `pkg/v1` to provide access to Lambda Labs cloud infrastructure.

## File Structure

- `client.go` - Main client implementation and interface methods
- `instance.go` - Instance management (create, terminate, list, etc.)
- `instancetype.go` - Instance type and location management
- `storage.go` - Volume management and resizing
- `networking.go` - Firewall and security group management
- `quota.go` - Quota management and limits
- `image.go` - Machine image management
- `capabilities.go` - Provider capabilities and features
- `errors.go` - Lambda Labs specific error handling
- `utils.go` - Utility functions and helpers

## Implementation Status

All files currently contain stub implementations with TODO comments. The actual implementation would need to:

1. Integrate with Lambda Labs API
2. Handle authentication and authorization
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Add comprehensive testing
5. Add logging and monitoring

## Lambda Labs API

The provider will need to integrate with the Lambda Labs Cloud API:
- Base URL: `https://cloud.lambdalabs.com/api/v1`
- Authentication: API key based
- Documentation: https://cloud.lambdalabs.com/api/v1

## Key Features

Lambda Labs is known for:
- GPU instances (A10, A100, H100, etc.)
- Global API (not location-specific)
- Simple pricing model
- Fast instance provisioning

## TODO

- [ ] Implement actual API integration
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests
- [ ] Add logging and monitoring
- [ ] Add configuration management
- [ ] Add documentation and examples
