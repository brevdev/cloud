# FluidStack Security Compliance

This document outlines FluidStack's security capabilities and compliance with Brev's security requirements.

## üîë SSH Access Requirements

**FluidStack instances must support SSH server functionality and SSH key-based authentication for Brev access.**

### SSH Implementation Status
- **SSH Server**: FluidStack instances include SSH server (OpenSSH) pre-installed and running
- **SSH Key Authentication**: FluidStack supports SSH public key injection during instance provisioning
- **Key Management**: Public SSH keys are configured in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` during instance setup
- **Network Access**: SSH access operates within FluidStack's project-level network isolation model

## ‚úÖ FULLY COMPLIANT

### Disk Encryption
- **Encryption at Rest**: Hardware-level self-encrypting drives (SEDs)
- **Implementation**: Automatic encryption without performance overhead
- **Coverage**: All data stored on FluidStack infrastructure
- **Standard**: Industry-standard encryption algorithms

### Transit Encryption
- **Protocol**: SSL/TLS encryption for all network traffic
- **Coverage**: All API communications and data transfer
- **Implementation**: Automatic encryption for all connections

### Network Isolation
- **Project-Level Isolation**: Dedicated L3 networks per project
- **Technology**: VXLAN and eBPF for network segmentation
- **Isolation Scope**: Hardware, network, and storage levels
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Single-tenant by default, no shared clusters

### Physical Security
- **Data Centers**: Tier-3 facilities with 24/7 surveillance
- **Access Controls**: Biometric access controls and mantrap entry systems
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring with CCTV coverage
- **Personnel**: Restricted access to authorized personnel only

### Compliance Certifications
- **HIPAA**: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation
- **ISO27001**: Information Security Management System
- **SOC 2 TYPE I**: Service Organization Control 2

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL COMPLIANCE

### Network Security Model
- **‚úÖ Outbound Traffic**: Instances can egress to public internet (compliant)
- **‚úÖ Project Isolation**: Strong isolation between projects (compliant)
- **‚ùì Inbound Traffic**: "Deny all inbound by default" behavior not explicitly documented
- **‚ùì Instance-Level Firewalls**: No API endpoints for individual instance firewall rules

### Firewall Management
- **Limitation**: Security managed at project/cluster level, not per-instance
- **API Gap**: No dedicated firewall rule management endpoints in Infrastructure API
- **Workaround**: Project-level isolation provides security boundary
- **Impact**: May not provide granular instance-level firewall control

## ‚ùå LIMITATIONS

### Granular Network Control
- **Missing Feature**: Individual instance firewall rule management
- **Alternative**: Project-level network isolation
- **API Support**: No explicit firewall rule endpoints found
- **Security Model**: Relies on project boundaries for isolation

### Network Security APIs
- **Firewall Rules**: No API endpoints for creating/managing firewall rules
- **Security Groups**: No security group concept or API
- **Network ACLs**: No network access control list management

## Security Implementation Notes

### Default Security Posture
```
‚úÖ Data encrypted at rest (hardware-level SEDs)
‚úÖ Data encrypted in transit (SSL/TLS)
‚úÖ Project-level network isolation (VXLAN/eBPF)
‚úÖ Physical security (Tier-3 data centers)
‚ùì Instance-level firewall rules (not documented)
‚ùì "Deny all inbound" default behavior (needs verification)
```

### Recommended Security Practices

1. **Project Organization**: Use separate projects for different security zones
2. **Network Design**: Leverage project-level isolation for security boundaries
3. **Access Control**: Implement application-level security controls
4. **Monitoring**: Use FluidStack's audit logging and monitoring features

### Security Verification Required

Before production deployment, verify:

1. **Default Inbound Policy**: Confirm if inbound traffic is denied by default
2. **Firewall APIs**: Check for any undocumented firewall management endpoints
3. **Network Behavior**: Test actual network isolation and traffic patterns
4. **Security Controls**: Validate project-level isolation effectiveness

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- **Data Encryption**: Excellent hardware-level encryption
- **Physical Security**: Strong data center security controls
- **Compliance**: Multiple enterprise certifications
- **Network Isolation**: Strong project-level isolation

### Medium Risk
- **Firewall Management**: Limited granular network control
- **API Limitations**: No explicit firewall rule management
- **Documentation Gaps**: Some security behaviors not explicitly documented

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Application Security**: Implement security controls at the application layer
2. **Project Design**: Use project boundaries as security zones
3. **Network Architecture**: Design applications to work within project isolation model
4. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Conclusion

FluidStack provides **excellent foundational security** with hardware-level encryption, strong network isolation, and comprehensive compliance certifications. However, it may not provide the granular instance-level firewall management that some security models require.

**Recommendation**: FluidStack is suitable for workloads that can leverage project-level security isolation. For applications requiring fine-grained instance-level firewall controls, additional verification and testing is recommended.
